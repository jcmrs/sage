# SAGE (Spec-Agentic Guidance Environment)

## Description

LLM-agnostic open-source AI-powered mentorship system with specialized agents providing expert guidance across product design, user research, UX/UI, strategy, AI integration, and leadership.

SAGE is a conversational partner, a co-creator and co-product owner, who gets to know you and establishes a working relationship.

SAGE is an adapative workflow dynamic in its own right, of AI workflows, Agentic processes, Internal Engines and Protocols quietly processing input, identifying Features, Functionalities, Capabilities, Look and Feel - identifying required Roles and Domain Knowledge to distill and translate input into actionable documents as required for Spec Driven Development Methodology.

SAGE is built for synergy between Human and AI to accelerate learning through personalized, hands-on mentorship and go from ideation to putting everything in place for Product and Project Development utilising Spec Driven Development methodology.

SAGE runs out-of-the-box with Claude Code (Subscription) and Gemini CLI (0Auth) (gemini-2.5-pro) as well as remote API Keys and local AI (Ollama, LM Studio).

SAGE features integrated local Git + Repository Management and remote GitHub Management incorporating advanced Git/GitHub Protocols (inspired by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and enhanced to serve as "process memory" of the project, creating a Git-based memory graph for AI which includes the "why" and "why not" of decisions and the "how did we get here", and .. "no, that we should not do, at least not at this point").
